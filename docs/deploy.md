## Prerequisites

### Required Tools

You need the following CLIs on your system to be able to run the script:

* [`kapp`](https://k14s.io/#install)
* [`ytt`](https://k14s.io/#install) (v0.26.0+)

In addition, you will also probably want [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) for your own debugging and inspection of the system.

Make sure that your Kubernetes config (e.g, `~/.kube/config`) is pointing to the cluster you intend to deploy CF for K8s to.

### Kubernetes Cluster Requirements
:exclamation::exclamation::exclamation: This is a highly experimental project and resource requirements are subject to change in the future. :exclamation::exclamation::exclamation:

To deploy cf-for-k8s as is, the cluster should:
* be running version 1.14.x, 1.15.x, or 1.16.x
* have a minimum of 5 nodes
* have a minimum of 3 CPU, 7.5GB memory per node

### IaaS Requirements

* support LoadBalancer services
  * requires a workaround on Minikube and Kind, for example
* define a default StorageClass
  * requires [additional config on vSphere](https://vmware.github.io/vsphere-storage-for-kubernetes/documentation/storageclass.html), for example

### (optional) Requirements for Cloud Native Buildpacks Support

To be able to push source-based apps to your CF for K8s installation, you will need to enable support for Cloud Native Buildpacks.

_Note: Currently, when enabling support for buildpack-based applications, CF for K8s has only been validated to work with Google Container Registry (GCR).  Soon, we intend to support any OCI registry that kpack supports._

To deploy cf-for-k8s with the Cloud Native Buildpacks feature, you additionally need to:
  1. create a GCP Service Account with `Storage/Storage Admin` role
      * (optionally) if you want to limit the permissions this service account has, see https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/access-control for the minimum permission set
  1. create a Service Key JSON and download it to the machine from which you will install cf-for-k8s (referred to, below, as `path-to-kpack-gcr-service-account`)

## Steps to deploy

1. Clone and initialize this git repository:
   ```console
   $ git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-for-k8s.git
   $ cd cf-for-k8s
   ```

1. Set your current kubectl context to your desired Kubernetes cluster

1. Create a "CF Installation Values" file and configure it:

   You can either: a) auto-generate the installation values or b) create the values by yourself.

   #### Option A - Use the included hack-script to generate the install values
   **NOTE:** The script requires the [BOSH CLI](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2-install/#install) to generate the install values from `bosh interpolate`
   ```console
   $ ./hack/generate-values.sh -d <cf-domain> > /tmp/cf-values.yml
   ```
   (replacing `<cf-domain>` with _your_ registered DNS domain name for your CF installation)


   If you wish to enable Cloud Native Buildpacks support, pass in the path to the GCP Service Account JSON:
   ```console
   $ ./hack/generate-values.sh -d <cf-domain> -g <path-to-kpack-gcr-service-account> > /tmp/cf-values.yml
   ```
   (replacing `<cf-domain>` with _your_ registered DNS domain name for your CF installation and `<path-to-kpack-gcr-service-account>` with the path to your GCP Service Account JSON file)

   #### Option B - Create the install values by hand
   1. Create a file called `/tmp/cf-values.yml`. You can use `sample-cf-install-values.yml` in this directory as a starting point
   1. Open the file and change the `system_domain` and `app_domain` to your desired domain address
   1. Generate certificates for the above domains and paste them in `crt`, `key`, `ca` values
      - your certificates must include a subject alternative name entry for the internal `*.cf-system.svc.cluster.local` domain in addition to your chosen external domain

   If you wish to enable Cloud Native Buildpacks support, configure access to your Google Container Registry:
   1. Update the "gcp_project_id" portion of `kpack.registry.repository` to your GCP Project Id
   1. Change `contents_of_service_account_json` to be the entire contents of your GCP Service Account JSON

   If you do NOT wish to enable Cloud Native Buildpacks support:
   1. Remove the `kubernetes` and `kpack` keys from your `cf-values.yml`

1. Run the install script with your "CF Install Values" file
   ```console
   $ ./bin/install-cf.sh /tmp/cf-values.yml
   ```

1. Configure DNS on your IaaS provider to point the wildcard subdomain of your
   system domain and the wildcard subdomain of all apps domains to point to external IP
   of the Istio Ingress Gateway service. You can retrieve the external IP of this service by running
   `kubectl get svc -n istio-system istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[*].ip}'`
   For AWS EKS use this command:
   `kubectl get svc -n istio-system istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[*].hostname}'`
   
   1. If you used the `./hack/generate-values.sh` script then you should only
      configure a single DNS record for the domain you passed as input to the
      script and have it resolve to the Ingress Gateway's external IP

      e.g.
      ```
      # sample A record in Google cloud DNS. The IP address below is the address of Ingress gateway's external IP
      Domain         Record Type  TTL  IP Address
      *.<cf-domain>  A            30   35.111.111.111
      ```
   2. If using AWS Route53 DNS service create the wildcard DNS entry using an alias pointing to the hostname you received when
      querying the `'{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[*].hostname}'`

## Validate the deployment using a image-based app

1. Set up cf cli to point to CF:
   ```console
   $ cf api --skip-ssl-validation https://api.<cf-domain>
   $ cf auth admin <cf_admin_password>
   ```

1. Create an org/space for your app:
   ```console
   $ cf create-org test-org
   $ cf create-space -o test-org test-space
   $ cf target -o test-org -s test-space
   ```

1. Enable docker feature:
   ```console
   $ cf enable-feature-flag diego_docker
   ```

1. Deploy an app based on a pre-built Docker image:
   ```console
   $ cf push test-app -o cloudfoundry/diego-docker-app
   Pushing app test-app to org test / space test as admin...
   Getting app info...
   Creating app with these attributes...
   + name:           test-app

   ```
   Note that the "`Failed to retrieve logs...`" messages are expected, at this time given that we're still working on integrating CF logging components.

1. Validate the app is reachable
   ```console
   $ curl http://test-app.<cf-domain>/env
   # should return JSON value
   ```

## (optional) Validate the deployment using a source-based app

If you have enabled support for Cloud Native Buildpacks:

1. Ensure that you have targeted your CF instance, created and targeted an org/space and enabled the `diego_docker` feature flag, as described above.

1. Deploy a source-based app:
```console
   $ cf push test-node-app -p tests/smoke/assets/test-node-app
   Pushing app test-node-app to org test-org / space test-space as admin...
   Getting app info...
   Creating app with these attributes...

You can delete CF4K8s deployment by running the following command.
```console
# Assuming that you ran `bin/install.sh...`
$ kapp delete -a cf
```
